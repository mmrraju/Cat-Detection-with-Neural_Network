# Cat-Detection-with-Neural_Network
Build Two layer Neural Network and L-Layer Deep Neural Network

### Abstruction: 
Image detection is one of the major field of Machine learning. My focus is to compare about the performance of classical ML algorithms and Deep learning. Here, I used Deep learning Neural network to understand how Deep learning work efficiently than single layer Neural network

### Accuracy
Two layer Neural Network : 60%
<br>
Deep Neural Network : 80%
